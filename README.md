# Voyager_CRS_Data
In this project, data collected by CRS onboard Voyager-1 is extracted from https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/voyager/voyager1/particle/crs/six_hour/ and stored in a text file and then a database. User can plot appropriate fluxes and compare graphs of at least two flux sets using vdb_plot_1.py
